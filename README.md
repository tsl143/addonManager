# Permission Inspector

[<img align="right" src="affiliate.png">](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/permission-inspector/)


Snapshot of all the permissions used by each installed extension.

## Why use Permission Inspector?
Firefox does not have any permission manager to check permission used by the installed addons in browser. This addon will provide details of all the permissions used by each installed extension and to check the details of which all installed extensions uses given permission. This addon is required in present because many addon asks for the permission that are not really needed and currently Firefox does not support to not select permission while installing addon from [addons.mozilla.org](https://addons.mozilla.org).
